## Description

A web application used to search for a certain book and if it catches your interest you can save it to your bookmarks and view later.

## Mock-Up

Let's start by revisiting the web application's appearance and functionality.

As you can see in the following animation, a user can type a search term (in this case, "star wars") in a search box and the results appear:

The user can save books by clicking "Save This Book!" under each search result, as shown in the following animation:

A user can view their saved books on a separate page, as shown in the following animation:
